Gaze is a web service that can do the following:

* Find the population density at a particular point (using GPW data)
* Return the radius of a circle around a point containing a number of people
* Find placenames around a point, limited to population or distance.
* Perform a placename geocoding of a search query (using USGS and GEOnet Names data)
* Return the ISO country code for an IP address

It is used on e.g. FixMyStreet to work out how wide to search to show reports
for a particular map, or on PledgeBank for local search.

Installation
============

Set up a PostgreSQL database using the schema in db/schema.sql

Fetch the single compressed zip that contains the entire country files dataset
from http://earth-info.nga.mil/gns/html/cntry_files.html and unzip it in an
empty directory.

In that directory, run geonames-split with that file as input. Run load-all.
This will import all the placename data for non-US countries. For the US,
fetch the Populated Places dataset from http://geonames.usgs.gov/ and
run usgs-geonames-parse.

gpw-parse - convert Gridded Population of the World data into the format Gaze uses.
